# API Labs

These labs are templates to walk through different concepts of the Platform API.  It assumes that you will run a http server on port 8080 with the root of the server in the lab you are working on.

## HTTP Server Example
Run the following steps to get a http server running for the oauth-implicit lab

```
npm install http-server -g
cd oauth-implicit
http-server
```

Now open up a browser to http://localhost:8080 and the page should load.
